Done an Internship during my vacations  from Emertxe Group Technologies where I implemented 
C program for an Simulation of Microwave Oven in PicSimLab using an controller PicGenious
PICf8477A which is having it's own HD LCD embedded in it, Fan, and Switches to communicate 
between Microprocessor and it's peripherals.
